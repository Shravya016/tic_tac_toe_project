The players take turns marking a square with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O') until one player achieves three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).  Technology Used: Python: Programming language used for game logic and interaction. Tkinter: Python's standard GUI library used for creating the graphical interface.
